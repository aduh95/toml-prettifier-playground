# TOML-prettifier playground

This is really just a toy project for me to learn how to use the
[Streams API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API).

I don't expect this to be useful to anyone as is, but I'm happy with that.

### Build locally

You would need [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) and
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 14+ to make it work.

```sh
yarn
yarn start
```

Also, this is using the
[import map proposal](https://wicg.github.io/import-maps/) which is still
experimental at the time of writing, so you may need to activate an option to
have it working.
